# quiz

Developed a javascript driven timed quiz which allows people top start a game by pressing a button. 

When the button is pressed the timer starts and the player is presented with a multiple choice question. 

If they answer correctly they move on to the next question until they finish the game.

If they answer incorrectly time is deducted and they can try again. 

When the game is over the player can save their name and score. 

The game can be viewed at:
